Kadfilre To Do List with CRUD functionality in React.

I would like you to build a To Do List with CRUD functionality in React:

- Your application should send a get HTTP request to the following API endpoint to get a list of to-do’s: https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos
- The Application should list all the stored to-do’s in a responsive manner
- Users Should be able to mark a to-do as completed or not
- Users should be able create new to-do’s, edit existing ones and delete them


The only interaction with the API should be the initial call to get a list of to-do’s, I’m happy for you to update, create and delete the to-do’s locally. Once complete could you upload the project to GitHub and email me a link.

There aren’t any requirements for anything else, feel free implement the UI however you wish. Bootstrapping the app with create-react-app is preferred to save time but if you wish to use something else you can. You shouldn’t take more than an hour or so on this, if you find it taking longer, please write a brief summary of what you what have done if you had more time.

Feel free to ask me any questions before you start.
